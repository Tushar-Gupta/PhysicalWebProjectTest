# PhysicalWebProjectTest
This repository contains the code I have written for PhysicalWebProject's GSoC'17 initial test.

There were two tasks -- Queue and Running Median

The code for each task is in their respective folders and can be run using 'python main.py'

For the Queue task, I have implemented a Queue class without the use of lists. This can be easily imported and used as has been done in the main.py file.

For the Running Median task, I have written a code that uses O(nlogn) time by making use of min and max heaps. For implementing heaps, the library 'heapq' has been used.
